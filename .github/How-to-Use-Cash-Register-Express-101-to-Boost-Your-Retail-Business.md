## Inventory Management
 
One of the most important aspects of running a successful retail business is keeping track of your inventory. With CRE, you can automate stock replenishment, purchase orders, back orders, and direct store deliveries. You can also use a handheld inventory device to receive inventory, complete accurate floor counts, and build POs. CRE also allows you to create kits, styles matrix, mix and match pricing, and commissions and consignment for your items. You can view your inventory by cashier ID, customer, vendor, store number, item, or department[^1^].
  
## Customer Loyalty
 
Another key factor for increasing your sales and profitability is building loyal relationships with your customers. CRE enables you to offer attractive loyalty and marketing programs to incentivize repeat purchases. You can set up discount levels, birthday specials, frequent shoppers, and custom branded gift cards with your business name. You can also charge orders to your on-house account system and manage layaway accounts with ease[^1^].
  
## Employee Scheduling
 
Labor is a big expense for any retail business, so you need to track hours and wages accurately and efficiently. CRE helps you with staff management by allowing you to build out your employee schedule using the labor scheduler and limit clock in/out times. You can also reduce loss and increase accountability by restricting what employees have access to in your POS system. You can limit discounts, no sales, voids, price changes, and more[^1^].
  
## Reporting
 
To make informed decisions for your retail business, you need to have access to comprehensive and accurate reports. CRE provides you with extensive reporting capabilities that let you view your data by cashier ID, customer, vendor, store number, item, or department. You can also view reports on sales trends, inventory levels, profit margins, taxes collected, employee performance, and more[^1^]. You can export your reports to Excel or PDF formats for easy sharing and analysis.
  
## Credit Card Processing Integration
 
One of the most convenient features of CRE is that it integrates seamlessly with credit card processing services. This means that you can accept all major credit cards and debit cards at your POS terminal without any hassle or extra fees. You can also process gift cards and EBT cards with ease[^1^]. CRE supports EMV chip cards and NFC payments for enhanced security and customer satisfaction.
