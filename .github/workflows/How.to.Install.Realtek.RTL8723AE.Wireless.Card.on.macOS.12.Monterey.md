## Method 1: Using a USB Adapter
 
The easiest way to use your Realtek RTL8723AE wireless card on macOS 12 Monterey is to buy a compatible USB adapter that can plug into your laptop's USB port. This way, you don't need to install any drivers or kexts on your system. You just need to plug and play.
 
One of the USB adapters that works well with macOS 12 Monterey is the TP-Link TL-WN823N. This adapter has a Realtek RTL8192CU chipset that is supported by macOS natively. You can buy it from Amazon or other online stores for around $15.
 
To use this adapter, you just need to follow these steps:
 
1. Plug the adapter into your laptop's USB port.
2. Go to System Preferences > Network and select the adapter from the list of devices.
3. Click on Advanced and enter your Wi-Fi network name and password.
4. Click on OK and then Apply to save the changes.
5. You should now be able to connect to your Wi-Fi network using the adapter.

This method is simple and convenient, but it has some drawbacks. For example, you need to carry an extra device with you, and you might experience some signal loss or interference due to the USB port. Also, you might not be able to use some features like AirDrop or Handoff that require a native Wi-Fi card.
 
## Method 2: Using an Open Source Driver
 
If you want to use your Realtek RTL8723AE wireless card on macOS 12 Monterey without buying a USB adapter, you can try using an open source driver that was ported from Linux. This driver is not official or supported by Apple or Realtek, so use it at your own risk. It might not work properly or cause some issues with your system.
 
The open source driver for Realtek RTL8723AE wireless card is available on GitHub[^2^]. You can download it from there or use this link[^3^] to get a zip file. To install this driver, you need to follow these steps:

1. Unzip the downloaded file and copy the folder rtlwifi\_new-master to your desktop.
2. Open Terminal and type `cd ~/Desktop/rtlwifi_new-master` and press Enter.
3. Type `make` and press Enter. This will compile the driver source code into a kext file.
4. Type `sudo make install` and press Enter. This will copy the kext file to your system's extensions folder.
5. Type `sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/rtl8723ae.kext` and press Enter. This will load the kext file into your system's kernel.
6. You should now be able to see your Realtek RTL8723AE wireless card in System Preferences > Network. You can configure it as usual.

This method is more complicated and risky, but it might give you better performance and compatibility than using a USB adapter. However, it might also cause some problems like kernel panics, system instability, or Wi-Fi disconnections. If you encounter any issues, you can try to unload the kext file by typing `sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/rtl8723ae.kext` in Terminal. If that doesn't work, you might need to delete the kext file from your system's extensions folder and reboot your system.
